# Awesome MicroPythons Timeline

To regenerate the timeline, edit timeline.csv, download a (binary recommended) version of [gnuclad](https://launchpad.net/gnuclad) and run:

```sh
gnuclad-0.2.4_amd64/usr/bin/gnuclad timeline.csv SVG timeline.conf
```

This will overwrite the current timeline.svg, which can be converted an adapted by free tools like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
